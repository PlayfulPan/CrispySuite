  abstract = {Converting low-frequency electrical signals into much higher-frequency optical signals has enabled modern communication networks to leverage the strengths of both microfabricated electrical circuits and optical fibre transmission, enabling information networks to grow in size and complexity. A microwave-to-optical converter in a quantum information network could provide similar gains by linking quantum processors through low-loss optical fibres and enabling a large-scale quantum network. However, no current technology can convert low-frequency microwave signals into high-frequency optical signals while preserving their fragile quantum state. Here we demonstrate a converter that provides a bidirectional, coherent and efficient link between the microwave and optical portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. We use our converter to transfer classical signals between microwave and optical light with conversion efficiencies of ∼10\%, and achieve performance sufficient to transfer quantum states if the device were further precooled from its current 4 K operating temperature to temperatures below 40 mK.},

Several exciting ideas include superradiance, increased optomechanical coupling, and quantum effects between distinct mechanical modes among others. Realizing these experiments has so far been difficult, because of the need for extremely precise positioning of the elements relative to one another due to the high-reflectivity required for each element. Here we overcome this challenge and present the fabrication of monolithic arrays of two highly reflective mechanical resonators in a single chip. We characterize the optical spectra and losses of these 200 μm long Fabry-Pérot interferometers, measuring finesse values of up to 220. In addition, we observe an enhancement of the coupling rate between the cavity field and the mechanical center-of-mass mode compared to the single membrane case. Further enhancements in coupling with these devices are predicted, potentially reaching the single-photon strong coupling regime, giving these integrated structures an exciting prospect for future multimode quantum experiments.},

We compare these calculations with measurements and find excellent agreement in cavities with empty-cavity finesses in the range 104–105. The imaginary part of the membrane's index of refraction is found to be ∼10−4. We calculate the laser cooling performance of this system, with a particular focus on the less-intuitive regime in which photons ‘tunnel’ through the membrane on a timescale comparable to the membrane's period of oscillation.

Standard perturbation-theory techniques, however, have difficulties when applied to Maxwell’s equations for small shifts in dielectric interfaces (especially in high-index-contrast, three-dimensional systems) due to the discontinous field boundary conditions—in fact, the usual methods fail even to predict the lowest-order behavior. By considering a sharp boundary as a limit of anisotropically smoothed systems, we are able to derive a correct first-order perturbation theory and mode-coupling constants, involving only surface integrals of the unperturbed fields over the perturbed interface. In addition, we discuss further considerations that arise for higher-order perturbative methods in electromagnetism.},

With these analytical solutions, one finds that extremely large optomechanical coupling of the membrane relative motion can be achieved in the limit of highly reflective membranes when the two membranes are placed very close to a resonance of the inner cavity formed by them. We also study the cavity finesse of the system and verify that, under the conditions of large coupling, it is not appreciably affected by the presence of the two membranes.

Work towards this goal has focused on increasing the strength of the coupling between the mechanical and optical degrees of freedom. However, the form of this coupling is crucial in determining which phenomena can be observed in such a system. Here we demonstrate that avoided crossings in the spectrum of an optical cavity containing a flexible dielectric membrane enable us to realize several different forms of the optomechanical coupling. These include cavity detunings that are (to lowest order) linear, quadratic or quartic in the membrane’s displacement, and a cavity finesse that is linear in (or independent of) the membrane’s displacement. All these couplings are realized in a single device with extremely low optical loss and can be tuned over a wide range in situ. In particular, we find that the quadratic coupling can be increased three orders of magnitude beyond previous devices. As a result of these advances, the device presented here should be capable of demonstrating the quantization of the membrane’s mechanical energy.},

  abstract = {A transmitting window is used to weakly couple two resonant optical cavities. When active medium is placed in one cavity, the system describes a laser coupled to a resonant cavity, while active medium in both cavities describes two coupled lasers. Equations of motion for the fields in the two cavities are found. These equations are solved in the steady state when the cavities are sufficiently closely tuned that the lasers in the two cavities oscillate with the same frequency. In the locked situation, the second cavity tends to stabilize the frequency of operation against changes in length of the first cavity. When there is no active medium in the second cavity, and that cavity becomes very long, the laser acts as if it were looking into free space.},

The grating has a reflectivity of over 99.8 \%, effectively creating two sub-cavities, with free spectral ranges of 6 GHz, optically coupled via photon tunneling. Measurements of the transmission and reflection spectra show an avoided crossing where the two sub-cavities simultaneously come into resonance, with a frequency splitting of 54 MHz. Expressions for the lineshapes of the symmetric and antisymmetric modes at the avoided crossing are derived, and the grating reflection, transmission, absorption, and scattering are inferred through comparison with the experimental data.},

A main goal has been to cool the devices optomechanically, freezing out all thermal vibrations, so that the object's motion eventually becomes limited by quantum mechanical fluctuations. This would make it possible to study a new range of quantum behaviour of mechanical objects. Thompson et al. report an improved design of such a system, involving a movable membrane sandwiched between two rigid high-quality mirrors. In previous designs one of the mirrors had to double-up as a microresonator. The new device achieves substantial cooling, from room temperature to 6.8 mK. It should eventually be possible to reach the quantum-limited ground state with this system.},

A notorious challenge in these experiments is the thermomechanical noise related to the dissipation through internal or external loss channels. Here we introduce a novel approach to define the nanomechanical modes, which simultaneously provides a strong spatial confinement, full isolation from the substrate and dilution of the resonator material's intrinsic dissipation by five orders of magnitude. It is based on a phononic bandgap structure that localizes the mode but does not impose the boundary conditions of a rigid clamp. The reduced curvature in the highly tensioned silicon nitride resonator enables a mechanical Q\,{$>$}\,108 at 1\hspace{0.25em}MHz to yield the highest mechanical Qf products ({$>$}1014\,Hz) yet reported at room temperature.},

  abstract = {Experimental observation of the decoherence of macroscopic objects is of fundamental importance to the study of quantum collapse models and the quantum to classical transition. Optomechanics is a promising field for the study of such models because of its fine control and readout of mechanical motion. Nevertheless, it is challenging to monitor a mechanical superposition state for long enough to investigate this transition. We present a scheme for entangling two mechanical resonators in spatial superposition states such that all quantum information is stored in the mechanical resonators. The scheme is general and applies to any optomechanical system with multiple mechanical modes. By analytic and numeric modeling, we show that the scheme is resilient to experimental imperfections such as incomplete precooling, faulty postselection, and inefficient optomechanical coupling. This proposed procedure overcomes limitations of previously proposed schemes that have so far hindered the study of macroscopic quantum dynamics.},

This new regime should realistically allow for achieving strong single-photon optomechanical coupling with massive resonators, realizing hybrid quantum interfaces, and exploiting collective long-range interactions in arrays of atoms or mechanical oscillators.},

A central goal of the field is achieving single-photon strong coupling, which would enable the creation of quantum superposition states of motion. Reaching this limit requires significant improvements in optomechanical coupling and cavity coherence. Here we introduce an optomechanical architecture consisting of a silicon nitride membrane coupled to a three-dimensional superconducting microwave cavity. Exploiting their large quality factors, we achieve an optomechanical cooperativity of 146,000 and perform sideband cooling of the kilohertz-frequency membrane motion to 34±5\,μK, the lowest mechanical mode temperature reported to date. The achieved cooling is limited only by classical noise of the signal generator, and should extend deep into the ground state with superconducting filters. Our results suggest that this realization of optomechanics has the potential to reach the regimes of ultra-large cooperativity and single-photon strong coupling, opening up a new generation of experiments.},
